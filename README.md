# Explore events

It's a software-based startup, a website catalogue for all the tech events, competition, workshops happening near you, basically a bridge between students and the organisers to help grow both , students to find events and showcase talent and organisers to find that talent

### Instlallation:

* To run this, you need set up a local MongoDB server or change the address, to an already existing one in `/app.js`

* Clone the repository : `git clone https://github.com/ishan-goswami/Explore-Events.git`

* Install dependencies : `npm install`

* Run MongoDB using the following command : `mongod`

* Open a new terminal and run the server : `npm start`

* Visit the frontend server at : `http://127.0.0.1:1337/`


Please note that this uses the `sessions` and `users` collection in the `events` database. If you are already using that, make a new database cluster.
